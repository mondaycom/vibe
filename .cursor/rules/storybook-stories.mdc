# Storybook Stories for @vibe/core library

This document outlines the rules and best practices for creating and maintaining Storybook stories for the `@vibe/core` library.

**Storybook Scope:** Storybook is exclusively used for the `@vibe/core` library within this monorepo. Do not create stories for components or utilities in other packages. Stories should _only_ be written for UI components found in `packages/core/src/components/`. Stories for custom hooks (e.g., `useWizard`) are not to be created.

## 1. File Structure and Naming Conventions

- **Location:** Component stories **must** be co-located with their respective component. Each component that requires stories must have a `__stories__` subdirectory.
  - Example: `packages/core/src/components/ComponentName/__stories__/`
- **Story File:** Inside the `__stories__` directory, the main story file **must** be named after the component, using PascalCase, followed by the `.stories.tsx` extension.
  - Example: `packages/core/src/components/ComponentName/__stories__/ComponentName.stories.tsx`
- **MDX File:** An accompanying MDX documentation file **must** also be created in the `__stories__` directory, named after the component.
  - Example: `packages/core/src/components/ComponentName/__stories__/ComponentName.mdx`

## 2. `.stories.tsx` File Structure and Content

All `.stories.tsx` files **must** adhere to Component Story Format (CSF) 3.0 and utilize TypeScript strictly.

### 2.1. Imports

- Import `React`.
- Import the Component itself.
- Import `Meta` and `StoryObj` from `@storybook/react`.
- Import any other necessary Vibe components or primitive types.
- **DO NOT** import story-specific helper utilities from other files. If a simple helper is absolutely needed for a complex story setup, define it within the `.stories.tsx` file itself.

### 2.2. Meta Configuration (Default Export)

The default export defines the component's metadata for Storybook.

```typescript
import React from "react";
import { Meta, StoryObj } from "@storybook/react";
import ComponentName from "../ComponentName"; // Adjust path as necessary
// Import other Vibe components or types if needed for stories

export default {
  title: "Components/ComponentName", // Or "Components/ComponentGroup/ComponentName" for grouped components
  component: ComponentName
  // args: { prop1: "initialValueForControls" }, // Optional: Define default args for controls panel here
  // Decorators are defined in section 2.5
  // subcomponents: { ComponentSubComponent, ComponentHeader } // etc. subcomponents can be listed here if applicable - only if needed
} satisfies Meta<typeof ComponentName>;
```

- **`title`**: A string that determines the component's path in the Storybook navigation sidebar (e.g., "Components/Button", "Components/Input/TextField").
- **`component`**: The component itself. This is used by Storybook for automatic documentation generation (props table) and linking stories.
- **`satisfies Meta<typeof ComponentName>`**: This TypeScript construct ensures the meta object conforms to the expected shape for the component.

### 2.3. Story Definition

Each named export in the file represents a single story.

```typescript
// Define the `Story` type for convenience and strict typing at the top of the file, right before the default exported metadata
type Story = StoryObj<typeof ComponentName>;

export const Overview: Story = {
  // All stories, including Overview, MUST have a render function.
  // The Overview story's render function should pass the args from controls directly to the component
  // to make it fully interactive with the Storybook Controls panel.
  render: args => <ComponentName {...args} />
  // DO NOT define story-specific args here. Props are set in the render function.
};

export const ComplexExample: Story = {
  // Props for this story are set directly within the render function.
  render: () => (
    <div>
      {/* args from controls can be used if needed, or overridden/ignored */}
      <ComponentName specificProp="fixedValueForThisStory" anotherProp={anotherPropFromControls || "default"} />
      {/* Other components or elements to showcase a specific scenario */}
    </div>
  )
  // DO NOT define story-specific args.
};
```

- **`type Story = StoryObj<typeof ComponentName>;`**: This type alias **must** be used for all story objects to ensure they are correctly typed against the component's props.
- **Story Naming:** Story exports should be in PascalCase (e.g., `PrimaryButton`, `WithIcon`).
- **NO `args` in individual stories:** Stories **must not** use the `args` property at the story level. All props for a story are defined and passed within its `render` function. The `Overview` story uses the `args` passed into its render function to be interactive.
- **Always provide an `Overview` story.** This story should be the primary, most common use case of the component and **must** be interactive with the Storybook Controls panel (via its `render: (args) => <ComponentName {...args} />` implementation).

### 2.4. Render Function

- **All stories MUST define an explicit `render` function.** This ensures consistency and clarity in how components are presented.
- **DO NOT USE `createComponentTemplate` or any other template/utility function for generating render functions.**
- The `render` function receives an `args` object as its first parameter. This object is populated by Storybook based on the component's props and any default `args` defined in the meta configuration. The `args` object is to be used only by the `Overview` story.
- **`Overview` Story Render:** The `Overview` story's `render` function **must** be `(args) => <ComponentName {...args} />` (or similar if simple wrapping is needed, or initial props required to start with) to ensure it directly reflects changes from the Storybook Controls panel.
- **Other Stories Render:** For other stories that showcase specific states or compositions:
  - They define their specific props directly when rendering the component within the `render` function.
  - They can choose to use some of the `args` from the controls (e.g., for base styling or less critical props) or completely ignore/override them with hardcoded values to ensure the story accurately depicts the intended specific state.
- Keep render functions as simple as possible, focusing on the component being storied.

Example of an `Overview` story's render function:

```typescript
export const Overview: Story = {
  render: args => <ComponentName {...args} />
};
```

Example of a specific state story's render function:

```typescript
export const DisabledState: Story = {
  render: () => <ComponentName disabled label="Cannot proceed" />
};
```

### 2.5. Decorators

Decorators are functions that wrap a story to provide additional context, styling, or behavior.

- Define decorators as an array in the `decorators` property of the `default` meta export (for global decorators) or on individual story objects.
- Each decorator is a function that takes the `Story` component (as a function) and the `context` object as arguments and **must render the `Story()` component**.
- Use decorators to provide wrapping UI (e.g., a fixed width container) but ensure they do not obscure the story's core purpose or make it hard to understand the component's usage through its `render`.

Example of a simple decorator:

```typescript
// In default export:
decorators: [
  (Story) => (
    <div style={{ margin: "1em", padding: "1em", border: "1px dashed #ccc" }}>
      <Story />
    </div>
  ),
  // Other decorators
],
```

#### Applying Decorators to Specific Stories

You can also apply decorators to individual stories if they are only relevant to that specific case. This is done by adding a `decorators` array directly to the story object.

**Example:**

First, define your decorator function (this could be in the same file or imported if it's a shared, non-story-specific utility decorator that conforms to Storybook's decorator signature):

```typescript
import { Decorator } from "@storybook/react";

const withGridDisplay: Decorator = Story => (
  <div
    style={{
      display: "grid",
      gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr))", // Example grid styling
      gap: "20px",
      padding: "20px",
      border: "1px dashed lightgray"
    }}
  >
    <Story />
  </div>
);
```

Then, apply it to a specific story:

```typescript
export const Sizes: Story = {
  render: () => (
    <>
      <Label text="Regular Size Label" />
      <Label text="Small Size Label" size="small" />
      {/* Add more Label instances to demonstrate different sizes */}
    </>
  ),
  decorators: [withGridDisplay] // Decorator applied only to this 'Sizes' story
};
```

This approach allows for targeted enhancements or layouts for specific stories without affecting others. You would usually prefer a decorator for all the stories within a specific stories file.

## 3. Styling in Stories

- **Prefer inline styles:** For story-specific styling, use the `style` prop on elements within the story's `render` function or in decorators. This makes the styles immediately visible to users who copy the story code.

  ```typescript
  export const Highlighted: Story = {
    render: () => (
      <div style={{ backgroundColor: "yellow", padding: "8px" }}>
        <ComponentName style={{ marginBottom: 4 }} disabled withAnimation />
      </div>
    ),
    args: {
      /* ... */
    }
  };
  ```

- **NO external CSS files (`.scss`, `.css`, `.module.scss`) for individual stories.** The goal is for story code to be self-contained and easily copyable.
- **Exceptions for CSS files:**
  1. If styling is for a **decorator** and helps provide a consistent story environment without being part of the component's direct example shown to user.
  2. If a component **does not support the `style` prop** for the required modifications - and it is a must to add styling to it.
  3. If very **complex or deep CSS modifications** are absolutely necessary that cannot be achieved with inline styles (e.g., targeting pseudo-elements of a child Vibe component for demonstration purposes).
  - If an exception is made, the SCSS/CSS Module file should be placed in the `__stories__` directory alongside the `ComponentName.stories.tsx` file. It should ideally be named similarly to the story file or component it primarily affects, for example, `ComponentName.stories.module.scss` (if generally applicable to stories in that file and primarily for decorators).

## 4. Story Content and Best Practices

- **Self-Contained Examples:** Stories **must** be as self-contained as possible. Users should be able to copy the code from a story's `render` function (or the story definition if no render function) and have it work in their application with minimal changes (assuming Vibe components are installed and imported).
- **NO external utility functions specific to stories:** Avoid referencing helper functions or helper components defined outside the story file (e.g., `TableAvatar` component or a `defineButtonGroup` util from an external helper). Even if a very simple helper is needed to reduce repetition for a complex story setup, define it a few times for each story within the `.stories.tsx` file. But always remember that you prefer not to use helpers at all, unless you must.
- **Focus on one feature/state per story:** Each story should clearly demonstrate a specific aspect, prop, feature, or state of the component.
- **Clarity over brevity (if complex):** While stories should be concise, ensure they are clear and easy to understand.
- **Interactive states:** For components with interactive states (e.g., loading, success, disabled), provide stories that demonstrate these states, potentially using `useState` within the story's `render` function if necessary, or other React hooks.

## 5. MDX Documentation (`ComponentName.mdx`)

An MDX file **must** accompany each `ComponentName.stories.tsx` file to provide rich, narrative documentation. It should be located at `packages/core/src/components/ComponentName/__stories__/ComponentName.mdx`.

### 5.1. MDX File Structure Template

The following is a template for `ComponentName.mdx`:

````mdx
import { Meta } from "@storybook/blocks";
import * as ComponentStories from "./ComponentName.stories"; // Import the stories
import ComponentName from "../ComponentName";

<Meta of={ComponentStories} />

# ComponentName

Brief overview of the component, its purpose, and when to use it. This can be multi-line.

## Import path

```tsx
import { ComponentName } from "@vibe/core"; // Or the correct export path for the component
```
````

```

## Overview

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Overview} />

## Props

<PropsTable />

## Usage

<UsageGuidelines
  guidelines={[
    "Guideline 1: Describe a primary use case or when to use this component.",
    "Guideline 2: Mention another important scenario or condition for its use.",
    "Guideline 3: Add a specific 'do' or 'don't' related to its application.",
    "..."
  ]}
/>

## Variants

{/_
Showcase various important stories using <Canvas>.
Provide a brief description for each use case.
Focus on distinct functionalities or appearances.
_/}

### Specific Use Case 1 Title

{/_ Description of this use case. _/}
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.SpecificUseCaseStoryName} />

### Specific Use Case 2 Title

{/_ Description of this use case. _/}
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.AnotherUseCaseStoryName} />

## Do's and Don'ts

{/*
  ALWAYS use the <ComponentRules /> component for this section.
  DO NOT import `ComponentRules`, as it is globally available, but do import any necessary assets (like images for visuals) at the top of the MDX file.
  Each rule object within the `rules` array should have a `positive` and a `negative` aspect.
  - For each aspect (`positive`/`negative`):
    - The `component` prop is for the visual example (e.g., <img src={...} /> or a React component).
    - If you do not have a visual for a specific 'do' or 'don't', use an example JSX element for the `component` (e.g., `<div>Do</div>`).
    - The `description` prop (string) is mandatory and should clearly explain the point.
*/}

<ComponentRules
  rules={[
    {
      componentContainerClassName: styles.largeComponentRule,
      positive: {
        component: (
          // Example with a visual component. Replace with your actual component or img tag.
          // <img src={exampleDoImage} alt="Visual example of what to do" />
        ),
        description: "Example Do: Clearly explain why this is a good practice. Be specific."
      },
      negative: {
        component: (
          // Example with an empty component when no visual is available.
          <></>
        ),
        description: "Example Don't: Clearly explain this pitfall or misuse. Be specific."
      }
    },
    {
      positive: {
        component: (
          // Another example
          <></>
        ),
        description: "Another Do: Focus on accessibility or a key integration point."
      },
      negative: {
        component: (
          // <img src={exampleDontImage} alt="Visual example of what not to do" />
        ),
        description: "Another Don't: Warn about potential issues or anti-patterns."
      }
    }
  ]}
/>

```

### 5.2. MDX Content Requirements:

- **Imports**:
  - The following components are globally available in MDX and **must not** be imported explicitly: `Canvas`, `Controls`, `PropsTable`, `ComponentRules`, `UsageGuidelines`, `RelatedComponent`, `RelatedComponents`, `StorybookLink`. They are automatically provided by the Storybook setup.
  - `import * as ComponentStories from "./ComponentName.stories";`: Import all stories from the corresponding `.stories.tsx` file.
  - `import ComponentName from "../ComponentName";`: Import the component itself (adjust path as necessary). This is often implicitly used by `<Controls />` or `<PropsTable />` via `<Meta of={ComponentStories} />` if `ComponentStories.default.component` is set, but explicit import can be useful for clarity or direct use.
- **`<Meta of={ComponentStories} />`**: Links the MDX file to the stories file. This is crucial for `<Controls />`, `<PropsTable />` and other features to correctly associate with the component and its stories.
- **Main Title (`# ComponentName`)**: The component's name.
- **Description**: A brief overview of the component. Use a simple string in the markdown.
- **Import Path**: Show users how to import the component from `@vibe/core`.
- **Overview Story**: **Must** display the `Overview` story from `ComponentName.stories.tsx` using `<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Overview}/>`. Add a brief contextual description.
- **Props Table**: **Must include an interactive props table using `<PropsTable />`** (globally available). Storybook will generate this based on the component's props when linked via `<Meta of={ComponentStories} />`.
- **Usage Section**: **Must** include a section titled "Usage" that utilizes the globally available `<UsageGuidelines />` component. This component takes a `guidelines` prop, which is an array of strings, as shown in the template.
- **Variants**: Showcase other important stories using the globally available `<Canvas of={ComponentStories.StoryName} />` component. Each example should have a descriptive sub-heading (`###`) and a brief explanation of the use case.
- **Do's and Don'ts**: This section **must** use the globally available `<ComponentRules />` component. Refer to the template in section 5.1 for the required structure. This involves providing a `rules` array, where each rule object has `positive` and `negative` aspects. Each aspect requires a `description` (string) and a `component` (JSX element). If a visual example for the `component` is not available, use an empty JSX element (e.g., `<></>`) or a simple textual placeholder (e.g., `<div>Do this</div>`).

By following these rules, we can ensure that the Storybook for `@vibe/core` is consistent, maintainable, and provides maximum value to its consumers.
