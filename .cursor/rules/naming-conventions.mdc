# Naming Conventions for @vibe/core

This document outlines the naming conventions to be followed when developing within the `@vibe/core` library, located under `packages/core/`. Adhering to these conventions ensures consistency, readability, and maintainability across the codebase.

## General Principles

- **Clarity and Predictability**: Names should be clear, unambiguous, and predictable.
- **Consistency**: Follow established patterns consistently across all files and components.

## File and Directory Naming

### Component Folders

- Each component resides in its own directory within `packages/core/src/components/`.
- Component directory names MUST use `PascalCase`.
  - Example: `packages/core/src/components/MyNewComponent/`

### Component Files

- **Main Component File**: The main React component file MUST be named `ComponentName.tsx`, where `ComponentName` matches the directory name (`PascalCase`).
  - Example: `packages/core/src/components/MyNewComponent/MyNewComponent.tsx`
- **Style Files**: SCSS module files for components MUST be named `ComponentName.module.scss`.
  - Example: `packages/core/src/components/MyNewComponent/MyNewComponent.module.scss`
  - Refer to the styling-conventions.mdc file in the monorepo for CSS/SCSS specific conventions.
- **Type Definitions**: TypeScript type definitions for a component MUST be placed in a separate file named `ComponentName.types.ts` and not within the main component file.
  - Example: `packages/core/src/components/MyNewComponent/MyNewComponent.types.ts`
- **Constants**: Files exporting constants specific to a component SHOULD be named `ComponentNameConstants.ts`.
  - Example: `packages/core/src/components/MyNewComponent/MyNewComponentConstants.ts`
- **Index File**: Each component directory MUST have an `index.ts` file that exports the main component and any other relevant modules (types, constants, etc.).
  - Example: `packages/core/src/components/MyNewComponent/index.ts`

### Sub-directories (within a component folder)

- **Tests**: Test files SHOULD be co-located with the code they test in respective `__tests__` subdirectories.
  - **Main Component Tests**: Place in `ComponentName/__tests__/ComponentName.test.tsx`
  - **Subcomponent Tests**: Place in `ComponentName/components/SubComponent/__tests__/SubComponent.test.tsx`
  - **Hook Tests**: Place in `ComponentName/hooks/__tests__/useHookName.test.ts`
  - **Utility Tests**: Place in `ComponentName/utils/__tests__/utilityName.test.ts`
  - **Context Tests**: Place in `ComponentName/context/__tests__/ComponentNameContext.test.ts`
  - **DO NOT** centralize all tests in the component root `__tests__` directory.
- **Stories**: Storybook files SHOULD be placed in a `__stories__` subdirectory.
  - Story files typically follow the pattern `ComponentName.stories.tsx`.
  - Refer to the storybook-stories.mdc file in the monorepo for Storybook specific conventions.
- **Helper/Utility Files**: Utility functions or helper components specific to a single component can be placed in a `helper` or `utils` subdirectory, or directly within the component folder if small and highly specific.
  - File names SHOULD be `camelCase.ts` for utils/helpers or `PascalCase.ts` if they export React components.
- **Custom Hooks**: Component-specific custom hooks SHOULD be placed in a `hooks` subdirectory.
  - Hook files SHOULD follow the pattern `useHookName.ts` and use camelCase.
  - If there's only one hook that's tightly coupled to the component, it can be placed directly in the component folder as `useHookName.ts`.

### General File Naming

- For general TypeScript files (e.g., hooks, utils) not specific to a single component, use `camelCase.ts` or `PascalCase.ts` if the file exports a React component.
- Directory names for common utilities or hooks (e.g., `packages/core/src/hooks/`, `packages/core/src/utils/`) SHOULD be `camelCase`.

## Code Naming Conventions

### Component Names

- React component names MUST use `PascalCase`.
  - Example: `const MyNewComponent = (props) => { /* ... */ }`.

### Prop Names

- Prop names for React components MUST use `camelCase`.
  - Example: `<MyNewComponent isLoading={true} userName=\"DefaultUser\" />`.
  - For boolean props, the name SHOULD clearly indicate the positive case.
    - Prefer prefixes like `is` or `has` for clarity (e.g., `isEnabled` or `isVisible` rather than just `enabled`).
    - Common, unambiguous adjective props like `loading`, `active`, `open`, `checked`, or `required` are also acceptable.
    - However, if the HTML attribute is `disabled`, using `disabled` is acceptable for consistency.

#### Prop Values

- **String Literals**: Component prop values should use string literals rather than static properties
  - Example: `<Button size="small" />` instead of `<Button size={Button.sizes.SMALL} />`

### Variable and Function Names

- Local variables and function names SHOULD use `camelCase`.
  - Example: `const itemCount = 5;`.
  - Example: `function calculateTotal() { /* ... */ }`.
- Constants (values that do not change) SHOULD be named in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
  - Example: `const MAX_USERS = 100;`.

### Enum Names

- Enum names SHOULD use `PascalCase`.
- Enum members SHOULD use `PascalCase` or `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` depending on the context.

### Type and Interface Names

- TypeScript type aliases and interface names MUST use `PascalCase`.
  - Example: `type UserProfile = { /* ... */ };`.
  - Example: `interface ComponentProps { /* ... */ }`.

### Vibe Standard Types

When working with Vibe components, always use the established standard types for common prop patterns:

- **Icon Props**: Always use `SubIcon` type for any prop that accept icons.
  - Example: `icon?: SubIcon;` instead of generic types like `ReactNode` or custom icon types.
- **Component Props**: Extend `VibeComponentProps` for component props (to get `className`, `id`, `data-testid`).
- **Consistent Typing**: Always check existing similar components to see what Vibe standard types they use before creating custom types.

### CSS Class Names

- CSS class names within `.module.scss` files MUST use `camelCase`.
- Refer to the styling-conventions.mdc file in the monorepo for more details.

### Context Naming

Context-related files and variables should follow these naming conventions to maintain clarity and consistency, typically residing within a `context/` subdirectory of a component (e.g., `packages/core/src/components/MyComponent/context/`).

- **Context File**: The file containing the context definition, provider, and consumer hook SHOULD be named `ComponentNameContext.ts` or `ComponentNameContext.tsx` (e.g., `ModalContext.tsx`).
- **Context Object**: The context object created by `React.createContext` SHOULD be named `ComponentNameContext` (e.g., `const ModalContext = createContext(...)`).
- **Provider Component**: The React component that provides the context value SHOULD be named `ComponentNameProvider` (e.g., `export const ModalProvider = (...)`).
- **Consumer Hook**: The custom hook for consuming the context SHOULD be named `useComponentName` (e.g., `export const useModal = () => ...`).
- **Context Props Type/Interface**: The type or interface defining the shape of the context value SHOULD be named `ComponentNameContextProps` (e.g., `interface ModalContextProps { ... }`).
- **Provider Props Type/Interface**: The type or interface for the Provider component's props SHOULD be named `ComponentNameProviderProps` (e.g., `interface ModalProviderProps { ... }`).
