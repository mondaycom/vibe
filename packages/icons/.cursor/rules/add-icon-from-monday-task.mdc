# Add Icon from Monday.com Task

When the user wants to add an icon from a monday.com task:

1. **Extract the item ID** from the monday.com URL (last number in the path)
2. **Use monday.com MCP tools** to get the task information and find the file attachment
3. **Get the asset public URL** and download the SVG file
4. **Extract and present the following information:**
   - Task name
   - Suggested icon name (PascalCase from task name, e.g., "Monday Vibe Logo" → "MondayVibeLogo")
   - Task description
   - Tags from task
   - Icon category (Basic, Platform, or View) - determine from task name/description/tags
5. **After data extraction is complete**, continue with the manual icon addition process (see `.cursor/rules/icon-generation-process.mdc`):
   - Place SVG file in `src/svg/` directory
   - Add metadata to `src/iconsMetaData.ts` using the extracted information
   - Add before the closing `] satisfies Icon[];` bracket
   - Add after the `// plop_marker:icon_metadata` comment
   - Run `yarn lint && yarn build` from the package root
   - Verify components were created successfully in `src/react/`

The build process automatically generates React components and lazy loaders.
