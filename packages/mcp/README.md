# @vibe/mcp

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the Vibe Design System, enabling LLMs and other MCP clients to interact with Vibe component metadata, icon information, and perform migration analysis.

## Usage

### Connecting AI Clients

Connect your AI client to the MCP server by following the instructions below.

#### Cursor

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg)](https://cursor.com/install-mcp?name=vibe&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IEB2aWJlL21jcCJ9)

Or manually update your Cursor MCP configuration file at `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (create it if it doesn't exist):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@vibe/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### VSCode
