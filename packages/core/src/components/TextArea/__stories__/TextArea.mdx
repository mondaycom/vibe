## Usage

<UsageGuidelines
  guidelines={[
    "Use text area to allow users to write multiple lines of text, usually for comments or descriptions.",
    "Placeholders should only be used when necessary."
  ]}
/>

## Accessibility

<UsageGuidelines
  guidelines={[
    "Using an `id` is highly recommended for all instances to ensure the best accessibility.",
    "Always provide a visible `label` to ensure the textarea's purpose is clear to all users.",
    "When using `label` or `helpText`, you must also provide an `id`. This is crucial, as it allows screen readers to correctly associate the textarea with its label and description.",
    "For required fields, use the `required` prop to ensure proper screen reader announcements and native browser validation.",
    "Provide descriptive error messages using the `error` prop with `helpText` to help users understand and correct validation issues.",
    "Character counting with `showCharCount` automatically provides accessibility labels for screen readers.",
    "Use the `aria-label` prop when a visible label is not desired but accessibility support is still needed.",
    "The component automatically handles `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` attributes for proper error and help text association."
