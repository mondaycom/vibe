## Overview

The Side-by-side Modal offers a layout with two distinct sections. The left side is reserved for providing information or inputs, like text fields or dropdown. The right side is reserved for visual media that supports the content on the left, like an image that adds context. This layout works best when users need to reference visual elements alongside textual information.

## Usage

<UsageGuidelines
  guidelines={[
    "This modal emphasis the balance between the textual inputs and visual media, so one doesn’t overpower the other.",
    "Use when you need to support textual inputs with visual media, like a visual diagram or set of instructions.",
    "Use when users need to compare textual information with visual media, like a preview or data visualization."

## Use cases and examples

### Wizard modal

For modals with multiple steps, use the ModalFooterWizard. You can use it to break down the tasks. Not every step must include an image.

### Header with icon button

In case of a need of an icon button in the modal header, you can use our default header "Action slot".
You can also use it as a <StorybookLink page="Buttons/MenuButton">menu button</StorybookLink> component.

### Animation

Each modal includes an animation type based on its entrance point, with wizard modals also featuring transition animations. The default is the center pop animation, which can be replaced with an anchor animation if there is a specific trigger to open the modal. Transition animation is used exclusively for wizard modals and cannot be changed or removed.
