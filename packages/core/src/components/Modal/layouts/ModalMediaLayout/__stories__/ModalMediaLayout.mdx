### Header with extra icon button

In case of a need of an icon button in the modal header, you can use our default header "Action slot".

### Animation

Each modal includes an animation type based on its entrance point, with wizard modals also featuring transition animations. The default is the element trigger animation, which can be replaced with a center pop animation if there's no specific trigger. Transition animation is used exclusively for wizard modals and cannot be changed or removed.
