# Media Modal

The Media Modal includes a highlighted media section, followed by a textual content area. This modal is intended for cases when you need to catch the user’s attention using visual elements before they interact with the text. It’s ideal for introducing new features or short onboarding flows.

### Announcement modal

Announcement modals used to effectively introduce new features or updates to users in a focused and engaging way. It is the media modal with predefine properties. To use an announcement modal, simply copy the code provided below.

### Header with extra icon button

In case of a need of an icon button in the modal header, you can use our default header "Action slot".
You can also use it as a <StorybookLink page="Buttons/MenuButton">menu button</StorybookLink> component.

<Canvas of={MediaModalStories.HeaderWithIconButton} />

### Animation

Each modal includes an animation type based on its entrance point, with wizard modals also featuring transition animations. The default is the element trigger animation, which can be replaced with a center pop animation if there's no specific trigger. Transition animation is used exclusively for wizard modals and cannot be changed or removed.
