## Overview

Search lets users quickly find relevant content. A search field allows a user to type a word or phrase to filter through a large amount of data without navigation.

## Import

```

## Props

## Usage

<UsageGuidelines
  guidelines={[
    "Search query input methods can be extended to include historical suggestions and auto-completion of queries.",
    "Search results are displayed below the search bar.",
    "Always use the search icon to help users identify search fields. Display the search icon as a presentational icon inside the search input.",
    "Let users submit their search by hitting enter. For live-filtering search, update search results immediately without hitting enter and be mindful of performance.",
    "Consider helping users understand what they can search for by offering placeholder examples or autosuggested results.",
    "Once the user starts typing, clear button should appear and remain accessible, even after a search is performed."
