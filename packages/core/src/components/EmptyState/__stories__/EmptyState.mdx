## Overview

An empty state component communicates to users that a particular section or feature contains no data or content. It provides visual cues, prompts, and clear actions to help users understand the current state and what actions they can take.

<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.Default} />

## Props

<Controls />

## Usage

### Guidelines

- Use empty states to explain why content is missing and guide users on how to proceed
- Always include a clear description of the current state
- Provide a primary action that helps users move forward
- Keep the messaging friendly and constructive
- Use appropriate imagery to reinforce the message
- Consider using the compact layout for smaller spaces or nested components

## Variants

### Without Title

For simpler empty states, you can omit the title while maintaining a clear description.

<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.WithoutTitle} />

### Compact Layout

Use the compact layout when the empty state needs to fit in a smaller space or when it's part of a larger interface.

<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.Compact} />

### With Button Supporting Action

When users need an alternative action, you can provide a supporting button instead of a link.

<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.WithButtonSupportingAction} />

### With Custom Image

Customize the visual element using React components to better match your interface.

<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.WithCustomReactNodeImage} />

### With Loading State

Show loading states when actions are being processed.

<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.WithDisabledActions} />

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do: Provide clear guidance and an action to help users resolve the empty state

<EmptyState
  title="No search results"
  description="Try adjusting your search terms or filters to find what you're looking for."
  mainAction={{ text: "Clear filters", kind: "secondary" }}
/>

### Don't: Use vague messaging or unhelpful actions that don't guide users

<EmptyState
  title="Empty"
  description="No items."
  mainAction={{ text: "OK", kind: "secondary" }}
/>

### Do: Offer clear next steps with supporting information when needed

<EmptyState
  description="Start by adding your first team member to collaborate."
  mainAction={{ text: "Add team member", kind: "primary" }}
  supportingAction={{ text: "Learn about teams", href: "#" }}
/>

### Don't: Provide minimal or unclear information about how to proceed

<EmptyState
  title="No team members"
  description="Your team is empty."
  mainAction={{ text: "Add", kind: "primary" }}
/>
