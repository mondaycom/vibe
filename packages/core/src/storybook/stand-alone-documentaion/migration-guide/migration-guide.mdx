## Intro

Vibe 3 is a major update to the Vibe design system, introducing several new features, enhancements, and breaking changes. This guide will walk you through the changes to help you transition smoothly from v2 to v3.

<Tip title="Migration from v1 to v2" emoji={false}>
  To migrate from v1 to v2, please refer to the [Vibe 2 migration
  guide](https://github.com/mondaycom/vibe/tree/master/docs/vibe2-migration-guide.md)
</Tip>

## New Features ‚ú®

### Package rename

The `monday-ui-react-core` package has been renamed to `@vibe/core` to better reflect the library's purpose and align with the Vibe branding. In addition, the `/icons` entry point has been moved to a new `@vibe/icons` package.

### Reduced bundle size

By removing CommonJS support, dividing the library into packages, and optimizing the library exports - the bundle size has been reduced by 43%, resulting in faster load times and improved performance.

### New Typography System

New and improved <StorybookLink page="Text/Heading">Heading</StorybookLink>, <StorybookLink page="Components/EditableHeading">EditableHeading</StorybookLink> components. For more info, check the [Typography](#typography) section.

### Enhanced Typescript Support

All components' types and interfaces are exported for better type-safe compositions. For example:

```tsx
import { Button, ButtonProps, ButtonSize } from "@vibe/core";
```

### Improved prop type-checking

Now you can use type-safe strings instead of static enums for props, providing a better and faster development experience:

```tsx
// Before
<Button kind={Button.kinds.PRIMARY} size={Button.sizes.SMALL}>click</Button>

// After
<Button kind="primary" size="small">click</Button>
```

See IntelliSense in action in your favorite IDE:

You can keep using the static properties, although not recommended, as they are likely to be deprecated in the future.

### Improved layering of floating components

When used inside Modals, the floating components (i.e., Tooltip, Tipseen, Dialog) will now be rendered inside the Modal's container by default, ensuring they are always on top. This change prevents any z-index interference and ensures a consistent user experience.

## Migration Steps üöÄ

Most of the changes required to migrate from Vibe 2 to Vibe 3 are covered by an automatic migration script, but some manual changes may still be required, especially changes that are related to style, UX, or behavior.

These steps will guide you through the migration process:

1. Install `@vibe/core` (and `@vibe/icons`, if needed) and remove `monday-ui-react-core`:

   ```bash
   yarn add @vibe/core @vibe/icons # or npm install @vibe/core @vibe/icons
   yarn remove monday-ui-react-core # or npm uninstall monday-ui-react-core
   ```

   The changes in your `package.json` file should look like this:

<ul>
  <DiffCodeBlock
    code={`"dependencies": {
- "monday-ui-react-core": "^2.120.0",
+ "@vibe/core": "^3.0.0",
+ "@vibe/icons": "^1.0.0"
  ...
},`}
  />
</ul>

2. Run the migration script to update your codebase:

   ```bash
   npx @vibe/codemod -m v3
   ```

   For more information, and for more options, refer to the [@vibe/codemod](https://github.com/mondaycom/vibe/blob/master/packages/codemod/README.md) docs.

3. Follow the changes in the [Breaking Changes üö®](#breaking-changes-) section below and apply any manual changes required.

4. **Review the changes and test your application thoroughly** to ensure everything works as expected.

5. Run Prettier or any code formatting tool to format the changes made by the migration script [optional].

## Breaking Changes üö®

Several breaking changes have been made to optimize and streamline the library. These changes include the removal of deprecated components, updates to component APIs, and overall enhancements.

Please note that the following changes are **complementary to the migration script** and require manual intervention, assuming that the migration script has ran successfully. If you prefer migrating entirely manually (without the `@vibe/codemod` script), please refer to the [Complete Vibe 3 changelog](https://github.com/mondaycom/vibe/blob/master/packages/core/docs/vibe-3-changelog.md).

### General

- **CommonJS support has been removed** to modernize the library, reduce complexity, and ensure better compatibility with modern JavaScript tooling and ESM (ECMAScript Modules) standards.
- The `monday-ui-react-core/storybookComponents` entry **was removed**, use the [vibe-storybook-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vibe-storybook-components) package instead.
- The `monday-ui-react-core/dist/main.css` **was removed**, use `@vibe/core/tokens` instead to load all relevant CSS tokens:

<ul>
  <DiffCodeBlock
    code={`- import "monday-ui-react-core/dist/main.css";
+ import "@vibe/core/tokens";
`}
  />
</ul>

- The `monday-ui-style/src/Icons` **was removed**, use `@vibe/icons/raw` instead to use svg icons:

<ul>
  <DiffCodeBlock
    code={`- import Close from "monday-ui-style/src/Icons/Close.svg";
+ import { Close } from "@vibe/icons/raw";
`}
  />
</ul>

### Typography

The typography system has been updated to provide a more consistent and accessible experience. The new typography system includes a set of predefined text styles and sizes that can be easily applied to components.

- Use the <StorybookLink page="Text/Text">Text</StorybookLink> component for paragraphs, labels, and texts up to
  16px. It includes 3 variants: <code>text1</code>, <code>text2</code> and <code>text3</code>. Each variant has a
  fixed size and three different weights.

- Use the <StorybookLink page="Text/Heading">Heading</StorybookLink> component the for titles and text from 18px and
  up. It includes 3 variants: <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code> and <code>h3</code>. Each of these variant is mapped
  to an <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code> element accordingly.

To replace old typography usages:

- **H1 Main heading** (`--font-h1`) ‚Üí **Heading/H1/normal**
- **H2 Secondary heading** (`--font-h2`) ‚Üí **Heading/H2/bold**
- **H3 Tertiary heading** (`--font-h3`) ‚Üí **Heading/H2/light**
- **H4 Fourth heading** (`--font-h4`) ‚Üí **Heading/H3/bold**
- **H5 Paragraph** (`--font-h5`) ‚Üí **Text/text1/bold**
- **H6 UI text** (`--font-general-label`) ‚Üí **Text/text2/normal**
- **Medium Text** (`--font-subtext`) ‚Üí **Text/text2/normal**
- **P Paragraph text** (`--font-paragraph`) ‚Üí **Text/text1/normal**
- **Medium text link** (`--font-general-label`, `--link-color`) ‚Üí **Text/text2/normal**

For more information, refer to the <StorybookLink page="Foundations/Typography">Typography</StorybookLink> docs.

### Components

The following components have been **removed** and are no longer available:

- `Input` - use <StorybookLink page="Components/TextField">TextField</StorybookLink> instead
- `EditableInput` - use <StorybookLink page="Components/EditableText">EditableText</StorybookLink> instead
- `SearchComponent` - use <StorybookLink page="Components/Search">Search</StorybookLink> instead
- `ResponsiveList` - use <StorybookLink page="Hooks/useIsOverflowing">useIsOverflowing</StorybookLink> hook instead, to show/hide content based on overflow

These components were **rewritten from scratch** with new API and style, offering better accessibility and usability:

- <StorybookLink page="Text/Heading">Heading</StorybookLink>
- <StorybookLink page="Components/EditableHeading">EditableHeading</StorybookLink>
- <StorybookLink page="Components/Search">Search</StorybookLink>

Make sure to import them from `@vibe/core` instead of the `/next` entry:

<DiffCodeBlock
  code={`- import { Heading, EditableHeading, Search } from "monday-ui-react-core/next";
+ import { Heading, EditableHeading, Search } from "@vibe/core";
`}
/>

The following components have breaking changes to their API, behavior, or style, as detailed below:

**AvatarGroup**

- The component no longer has padding at the bottom

**Button**

- The `children` prop is now required
- The `sm`, `md`, `lg` sizes were removed, use `small`, `medium`, `large` respectively:

<ul>
  <DiffCodeBlock
    code={`- <Button size="sm">
+ <Button size="small">
`}
  />
</ul>

**Chips**

- The `DARK_INDIGO` and `BLACKISH` colors were removed from the `color` prop
- The `clickable` and `isClickable` props were removed, use `onClick` instead, to get clickable behavior and style:

<ul>
  <DiffCodeBlock
    code={`- <Chips clickable>
+ <Chips onClick={() => {}}>
`}
  />
</ul>

**Counter**

- The `sm`, `md`, `lg` sizes were removed, use `small`, `medium`, `large` respectively:

<ul>
  <DiffCodeBlock
    code={`- <Counter size="sm">
+ <Counter size="small">
`}
  />
</ul>

**DialogContentContainer**

- The "medium" `size` now has an increased padding, correcting a previous sizing issue where "medium" and "small" had identical paddings. As a result, "small" is now the default size. If no size was specified there's no action required.

**Flex**

- The `Flex.gaps.NONE` property has been removed. To specify no gap simply omit the `gap` prop

**Dropdown**

- The `xxs`, `xs` sizes were acting as the `small` size and were therefore removed. Use `small` instead
- New readonly style

**Icon**

- The `clickable`, `onClick` props were removed, use `<IconButton>` for clickable icons:

<ul>
  <DiffCodeBlock
    code={`- <Icon icon={Heart} clickable onClick={() => {}}>
+ <IconButton icon={Heart} onClick={() => {}}>
`}
  />
</ul>

**Label**

- The "Spin In" animation was removed

**MenuButton**

- The `hideWhenReferenceHidden` prop default value changes to "true", meaning when the MenuButton is hidden hide the dialog and tooltip as well. To disable this behavior set `hideWhenReferenceHidden` to "false"

**MenuItem**

- The provided tooltip (when the text is overflowing) now wraps the entire element so non-block layout given to the `title` prop may break

**Modal**

- The `hideCloseButton` has been removed since Modals should always have a close button. It has also been removed from ModalHeader component.
- The `unmountOnClose` prop default value changes to "true", meaning the Modal will not render when `show` is "false". To disable this behavior set `unmountOnClose` to "false"
- Tooltips, Tipseens, and Dialogs on Modals will now be rendered inside the Modal's container by default, without any z-index interference

**SplitButton**

- The `data-testId` prop will no longer be applied to the internal elements, only the root element

**Steps**

- The `isOnPrimary` prop was removed, use `color="primary` instead:

<ul>
  <DiffCodeBlock
    code={`- <Steps isOnPrimary>
+ <Steps color="primary">
`}
  />
</ul>

**Tabs**

- The browser's default margin/padding for `ul` and `li` elements were reset

**TabList**

- The component no longer gets a padding bottom

**TabPanels**

- TabPanels will render only the active tab instead of rendering all the panels

**TextField**

- The `iconsNames` prop no longer accepts the `layout` property
- Providing the `required` prop will now show a red asterisk, implying that the field is mandatory, and so the `requiredAsterisk` prop was removed
- New readonly style
- The `sm`, `md`, `lg` sizes were removed, use `small`, `medium`, `large` respectively:

<ul>
  <DiffCodeBlock
    code={`- <TextField size="sm">
+ <TextField size="small">
`}
  />
</ul>

**Tipseen**

- The `content` prop is now mandatory
- The default `color` has changed from 'primary' to 'inverted'. To keep the previous color, set the `color` prop to 'primary'
- The `showDelay` prop's default value has changed to 100
- The `justify` prop was removed, and so the `Tipseen.justifyTypes` static property was removed as well

**TipseenContent**

- The `submitButtonProps`, `dismissButtonProps` props were removed, use `submitButtonText` and `dismissButtonText` to change the buttons' text

**Tooltip**

- The `paddingSize`, `justify`, and `arrowPosition` props were removed. Accordingly the `Tooltip.paddingSizes`, `Tooltip.justifyTypes`, and `Tooltip.arrowPositions` static properties were removed as well
- The `theme` prop can now accept only "dark" or "primary"
- The `position` prop can now accept only "top, right, bottom, left"
- The `showOnDialogEnter` prop's default value has changed to `true`; now the tooltip will remain open by default when hovering over it
- The `hideDelay` prop's default value changed to 100
- The `addKeyboardHideShowTriggersByDefault` default changed to true, making it accessible with keyboard navigation
- The tooltip's max-width is now set to 240px
- The Tooltip's `content` is now wrapped in another `div`, meaning that non-block layouts inside the tooltip may break
- The `containerSelector` will now fallback to `document.body` instead of `#tooltips-container` if not provided

### Colors

- The `--shareable-color` and `--private-color` CSS variables were removed for all themes
- The `color-warning`, `color-warning-hover`, `color-warning-select`, `color-warning-select-hover` colors were removed from the `colors.json` file (in `monday-ui-style` package), use `warning-color-*` respectively

### Icons

- The `Upgrade` icon has been removed, and the `Featured` icon has been renamed to `Upgrade`:
- The `Replay` icon has been renamed to `Reply`

<ul>
  <DiffCodeBlock
    code={`- <Icon icon={Featured}>
+ <Icon icon={Upgrade}>
`}
  />
</ul>

## FAQ ‚ùì

**What is the best way to migrate to Vibe 3?**

It is recommended to follow the migration steps outlined in this guide to ensure a smooth transition from Vibe 2 to Vibe 3.

**Are there any manual changes required after running the migration script?**

While the migration script covers most changes, some manual changes may still be required where style, UX, or behavior changes are involved. You should walk through the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes-) section to identify any manual changes required.

**Do I need to stop using static properties (e.g. `Button.kinds.PRIMARY`) in my code?**

You can still use static properties, but it is recommended to use type-safe strings instead. Static properties are likely to be deprecated in the future. To migrate to type-safe strings, use the following script: `npx @vibe/codemod -m enums`.

**I have already been using Heading, EditableHeading, Search from `/next`, do I need to change anything?**

If you have been using these components from `/next`, you will only need to update your imports to use the components from the main entry (`@vibe/core`).

**Are there any known issues or limitations with Vibe 3?**

While we have made every effort to ensure Vibe 3 is stable and reliable, there may be some known issues or limitations. If you encounter any problems, please create an [issue](https://github.com/mondaycom/vibe/issues/new/choose).

**What if I don't want to migrate to Vibe 3?**

While we recommend migrating to Vibe 3 to take advantage of the new features and improvements, you can continue using Vibe 2. However, please note that Vibe 2 will no longer recieve any new features or updates aside from critical bug fixes, and will reach EOL upon the next major version (Vibe 4) release.

**The migration script failed to run, what should I do?**

Make sure to run the migration script in the root directory of your project, and make sure to run it on a clean git branch to avoid any conflicts. If you still encounter issues, please create an [issue](https://github.com/mondaycom/vibe/issues/new/choose) describing the steps, system info and any error messages you received.
