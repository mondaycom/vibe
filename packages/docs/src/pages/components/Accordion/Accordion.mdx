# Accordion

Accordion is a vertically stacked list of items. Each item can be "expanded" or "collapsed" to reveal the content within with that item.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Overview} />

### Import

```js
import { Accordion, AccordionItem } from "@vibe/core";
```

## Props

<PropsTable />

## Usage

<UsageGuidelines
  guidelines={[
    "Use accordion reduce clutter and chunk the information one by one",
    "Accordion Label must be short, clear, and understandable to indicate what's inside",
    "Default state of accordion is closed unless used for navigation",
    "Accordion content can include icons, radio buttons, and checkboxes"
  ]}
/>

## Accessibility

<UsageGuidelines
  guidelines={[
    <>
      Provide an <code>id</code> for the Accordion to enable proper accessibility associations and unique
      identification.
    </>,
    <>
      Provide unique <code>id</code> props for each AccordionItem to ensure proper ARIA relationships between buttons
      and their controlled content regions.
    </>,
    <>
      Use descriptive <code>title</code> props for AccordionItem headers that clearly indicate what content will be
      revealed when expanded.
    </>,
    <>
      Use the <code>defaultIndex</code> prop to set initial expanded states appropriately. Avoid auto-expanding too many
      items to prevent overwhelming screen reader users.
