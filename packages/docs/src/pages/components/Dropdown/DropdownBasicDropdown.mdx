# Basic Dropdown

The basic dropdown is intended for quick value selection when space is limited and the list of options doesn't need to remain visible. It typically is used when you have 5-8 items to choose from where an action is initiated based on the selection.

All the Dropdown components can be imported from `@vibe/core/next`.

Notice not to import components directly from the `@vibe/core` package, as they are deprecated.

    "When the menu is open, each option in the menu should be the same height as the field.",
    "When organizing dropdown menu items, sort the list in a logical order by putting the most selected option at the top."
