# Modal

<p style={{ marginBlockEnd: "var(--sb-spacing-xxxl)" }}>
  Modals help users focus on a single task or a piece of information by popping up and blocking the rest of the page's
  content. Modals disappear when user complete a required action or dismiss it. Use modals for quick, infrequent tasks.
  We have 3 different modal component, each one provide a different layout for a different use case:
</p>

### Import

All the Modal-related components can be imported from `@vibe/core`.

```ts
import {
  Modal,
  ModalHeader,
  ModalContent,
  ModalMedia,
  ModalFooter,
  ModalFooterWizard,
  ModalBasicLayout,
  ModalSideBySideLayout,
  ModalMediaLayout
} from "@vibe/core";
```

### Basic modal

The <StorybookLink page="Components/Modal/Basic modal">Basic Modal</StorybookLink> is intended for straightforward tasks, like selecting items or gathering basic information. Basic Modals help users focus on a single task without distractions. These modals do not support images or videos.

<Canvas of={BasicModalPreview} sourceState="none" />

### Side by side modal

The <StorybookLink page="Components/Modal/Side by side modal">Side-by-Side Modal</StorybookLink> offers two distinct sections: the left for text or inputs, and the right for supporting visuals.
It's ideal when users need to reference media alongside information.

<Canvas of={SideBySideModalPreview} sourceState="none" />

### Media modal

The <StorybookLink page="Components/Modal/Media modal">Media Modal</StorybookLink> includes a highlighted media section followed by text, perfect for grabbing attention with visuals before users interact with the content. Ideal for introducing new features or onboarding.

<Canvas of={MediaModalPreview} sourceState="none" />

## Usage

<UsageGuidelines
  guidelines={[
    "Use modals only when you need the user's full, immediate attention.",
    "Modals are centered on the page. To put the modal in focus, the rest of the page is dimmed.",
    "All modals must have a title, a call to action, and a close button. The title and call to action should be simple and clear.",
    "By default, users can close modals by clicking the close button, clicking outside the modal, or pressing the ESC key."

<ModalTip />

## Accessibility

The Modal component provides several built-in enhancements to simplify usage and improve accessibility:

<UsageGuidelines
  guidelines={[
    <span>
      <b>Scroll lock:</b> While the modal is open, it prevents background content from scrolling, ensuring user focus
      remains on the modal.",
    </span>,
    <span>
      <b>Focus lock:</b> Keeps focus within the modal elements, preventing users from tabbing outside of the modal while
      it is open. Focus also automatically returns to the last focused element upon closing.
    </span>,
    <span>
      <b>Aria attributes:</b> For better screen reader support, using <code>ModalHeader</code> - with simple string
      values for <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> props - automatically sets the necessary{" "}
      <code>aria-labelledby</code> and <code>aria-describedby</code> attributes on the modal.
    </span>,
    <span>
      <b>Manual ARIA for complex content:</b> If you pass a <b>ReactNode</b> (e.g., a custom component) as the{" "}
      <code>title</code> or <code>description</code> prop to <code>ModalHeader</code>, you <b>must</b> assign a unique{" "}
      <code>id</code> to your primary custom element within that ReactNode. Then, pass this <code>id</code> directly to
      the parent <code>Modal</code> component using the <code>aria-labelledby</code> (for title) or{" "}
      <code>aria-describedby</code> (for description) prop. This ensures assistive technologies can correctly identify
      the modal's label and description. For example, if your custom title is{" "}
      <code>&lt;CustomTitleComponent id="my-unique-title-id" /&gt;</code>, you would pass{" "}
      <code>aria-labelledby="my-unique-title-id"</code> to the <code>&lt;Modal&gt;</code> component.
    </span>,
    <span>
      <b>Overriding ARIA attributes:</b> Additionally, you can directly provide the <code>aria-labelledby</code> and{" "}
      <code>aria-describedby</code> props to the <code>Modal</code> component itself, regardless of how you use the{" "}
      <code>ModalHeader</code>. If provided, these props will <b>always override</b> any automatically generated values
      from <code>ModalHeader</code>.
    </span>
