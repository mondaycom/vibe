# Basic modal

The Basic Modal is intended for straightforward tasks, like selecting items or gathering basic information. Basic Modals help users focus on a single task without distractions. These modals do not support images or videos.

Notice not to import components directly from the `@vibe/core` package, as they are deprecated.

## Variants

### Sizes

The modal component has three sizes - small, medium, and large. The modal width is responsive and adjust in width based on screen size. Each size also has a maximum height to keep harmonic window ratio, while the content area adapting to fit.

### Alert Modal

Use the "alertModal" boolean prop in order to allow closing the modal only by the close buttons and not by ESC or by clicking outside. Use this variant in case of sensitive or important messages, and in modals that requires data from the user, such as forms.

<Canvas of={ModalBasicLayoutStories.AlertModal} />

## Scroll

When the content of the modal is too large to fit within the viewport, the modal content should become scrollable while the header and footer stay sticky. If the scroll is too long, consider switching to a different modal size or a different layout.

## Use cases and examples

### Wizard modal

For modals with multiple steps, use the ModalFooterWizard.

### Footer with extra content

The footer has an option to include additional content on the left side when needed. This extra content can consist of a button, checkbox, or simple text for notes. Note that this option is only available with the default footer.

<Canvas of={ModalBasicLayoutStories.FooterWithExtraContent} />

### Header with icon button

In case of a need of an icon button in the modal header, you can use our default header "Action slot".
You can also use it as a <StorybookLink page="Buttons/MenuButton">menu button</StorybookLink> component.

<Canvas of={ModalBasicLayoutStories.HeaderWithIconButton} />

### Animation

Each modal includes an animation type based on its entrance point, with wizard modals also featuring transition animations. The default is the center pop animation, which can be replaced with an anchor animation if there is a specific trigger to open the modal. Transition animation is used exclusively for wizard modals and cannot be changed or removed.
