# Chip

Chips are compact elements that represent an input, attribute, or action. They may display text, icons, or both.

<Canvas of={ChipsStories.Overview} />

### Import

```js
import { Chips } from "@vibe/core";
```

## Props

<PropsTable />

## Usage

<UsageGuidelines
  guidelines={[
    "Chips represent a complex piece of information in compact form, such as an entity (person, place, or thing) or text. They enable user input and verify that input by converting text into chips.",
    "Use 8px spacing between chips.",
    "Use chips when content is mapped to multiple categories, and the user needs a way to differentiate between them."
  ]}
/>

## Accessibility

<UsageGuidelines
  guidelines={[
    <>
      Provide an <code>id</code> for the Chips to enable proper accessibility associations and unique identification.
    </>,
    <>
      For removable chips, use the <code>closeButtonAriaLabel</code> prop to provide a descriptive accessible name for
      the remove button (defaults to "Remove", but should be more specific like "Remove John Smith" or "Delete tag").
    </>,
    <>
      Use the <code>ariaLabel</code> prop when the visible <code>label</code> text alone doesn't provide enough context
      for screen readers to understand the chip's purpose or when chips contain complex content.
    </>,
    <>
      For clickable chips, ensure the <code>ariaLabel</code> describes the action that will occur when clicked.
    </>,
    <>
      When using icons or avatars in chips, ensure they are purely decorative and don't replace the descriptive text.
      Screen readers will announce the text content, and icons should be hidden from assistive technologies.
    </>
